# Chess.com Dark Theme Compliment (unofficial) - Chrome Extension

A dark theme for more parts of the chess.com site which aren't covered by the original dark theme.

Ensure you have the official Dark theme enabled on chess.com - this isn't here to replace it, but to compliment it.

## Development

Add the chrome extension locally to your chrome://extensions while in Developer mode.

To compile the sass to a css file, use:

```
sass --watch background.scss:background.css
```

Then restart the chrome extension.

## Motivation

On some pages, chess.com being used at night in a dark room can be painful on the eyes. The DarkReader extension usually solves these cases, but does not work well at all on chess.com. This extension solves the problem.
